School of Criminology & Crim J 
Arizona State University
Tempe, AZ

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Research Aide position with the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, specifically for the diversion program evaluation led by Dr. Shi Yan. As a current undergraduate student at Arizona State University pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Data Analytics, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to impactful research focused on community-based diversion programs.

My background includes a strong interest in qualitative social scientific research, particularly in the context of criminal justice and gender-related issues. I have completed coursework in Crime Control Policies and Inequality, Crime and Criminal Justice, which has equipped me with a solid foundation in the principles and challenges facing the justice system. My experience in these courses has also fostered my critical thinking skills, allowing me to analyze complex social issues effectively.

Being bilingual in Spanish and English, I am well-prepared to recruit and interview Spanish-speaking program participants. My strong communication skills will enable me to engage effectively with participants and gather valuable insights regarding their life histories and experiences within the program. Additionally, I am adept at translating materials, which will facilitate clear communication and understanding throughout the research process.

In my previous role as a Data Analysis Intern at YWCA in Delhi, I led a team in a research project that involved qualitative data collection and analysis. This experience taught me the importance of detail-oriented data management and the ethical considerations involved in working with vulnerable populations. I am confident that my experience will contribute positively to the outreach efforts of the Office of Sex Trafficking Intervention Research.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to work under the guidance of the Principal Investigator and contribute to meaningful research that can inform policy and practice in the field of criminal justice. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my skills and experiences align with the goals of your research team.

Warm Regards,
Armaan Sood
