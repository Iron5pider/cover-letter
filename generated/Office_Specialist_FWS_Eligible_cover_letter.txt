Dean of Students Tempe 
Arizona State University
Tempe, AZ

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Office Specialist position within the Office of the Dean of Students at Arizona State University. As a current undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Data Analytics, I am eager to contribute my skills in customer service, communication, and administrative support to your team.

In my recent role as a Security Aide at ASU Gammage, I ensured the safety and satisfaction of over 3,000 patrons per event. This experience required me to communicate effectively, triage concerns swiftly, and maintain a calm demeanor in high-pressure situations. I believe these skills will be invaluable in handling sensitive inquiries and providing direction to students and parents in the Office of the Dean of Students.

Additionally, my experience in hotel management at Courtyard by Marriott involved managing front-desk operations, where I handled guest check-ins, resolved issues, and ensured smooth communication across departments. I developed proficiency in multi-line phone systems and customer relationship management (CRM) software, which will enable me to manage a high volume of phone calls and inquiries effectively.

I am detail-oriented and organized, with a proven ability to follow oral and written instructions. My background in data entry, filing, and document preparation will allow me to support various administrative tasks efficiently. I am also committed to maintaining confidentiality and exercising sound judgment, particularly when dealing with sensitive topics.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to represent the Office of the Dean of Students and support initiatives that enhance the student experience at ASU. I am available for the preferred schedule and am eager to contribute to your team's success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the needs of your office.

Warm Regards,
Armaan Sood
