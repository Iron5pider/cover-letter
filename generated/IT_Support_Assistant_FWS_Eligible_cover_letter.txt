Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the IT Support Assistant position at Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College. As a current undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Data Analytics at Arizona State University, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your IT Support team by providing excellent customer service and technical assistance to faculty, staff, and student workers.

In my previous role as a Security Aide at ASU Gammage, I developed strong communication and problem-solving skills while ensuring the safety and satisfaction of over 3,000 patrons during events. This experience required me to respond quickly to inquiries and resolve issues effectively, which aligns well with the customer service focus of the IT Support Assistant role. Additionally, my experience managing front-desk operations at Courtyard by Marriott has further enhanced my ability to handle high-pressure situations while maintaining a positive demeanor.

I possess a solid understanding of both Windows and Mac operating systems, having worked extensively with various software applications, including Microsoft O365 and Google Workspace. My technical skills are complemented by my ability to troubleshoot hardware and software issues, which I developed through hands-on experience setting up and configuring computer systems in previous roles. I am also comfortable with the installation of peripherals and have a keen interest in technology, making me well-suited for this position.

I am detail-oriented and reliable, with a strong ability to follow instructions and work independently or as part of a team. My flexible schedule allows me to be available for up to 20 hours per week, and I am enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to the success of the IT Support team at MLFTC.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills can support the IT needs of Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College.

Warm Regards,
Armaan Sood
