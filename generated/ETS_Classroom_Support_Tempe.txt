Arizona State University
Tempe, AZ

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the ETS Classroom Support position at the Tempe campus. As a current undergraduate student at Arizona State University pursuing a degree in Business Data Analytics, I have developed a solid foundation in technical skills, professional communication, and problem-solving abilities that align well with the requirements of this role.

With over a year of experience working in various technical support capacities, I have gained hands-on skills in installing, upgrading, configuring, and troubleshooting both hardware and software. My role as a Lead Data Engineer allowed me to manage and maintain numerous computer systems, where I honed my ability to solve technical issues efficiently while ensuring that lab and classroom environments were fully operational. My strong attention to detail and proactive approach enable me to identify potential problems before they arise, ensuring minimal disruption to faculty, staff, and students.

I pride myself on my excellent communication skills, which have been essential when collaborating with diverse teams and supporting users with varying levels of technical knowledge. Whether assisting students with software installations or providing faculty with technical support, I always strive to convey information clearly and effectively. This experience has taught me the importance of being approachable, as well as the value of expanding my skill set by learning from others in the field.

I am committed to maintaining a regular 20-hour work schedule, including during school breaks, and I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to a productive and organized classroom environment. I understand the importance of keeping classroom and lab equipment clean and well-maintained, and I am comfortable working with sanitation equipment and supplies to ensure that all areas meet the highest standards.

I am excited about the prospect of joining the ETS team and providing essential technical support to the ASU community. Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with the needs of your team.

Warm Regards,
Armaan Sood
