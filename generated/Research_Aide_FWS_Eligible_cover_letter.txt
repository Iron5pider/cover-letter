Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Research Aide position focused on autism research clinical trials. As a current undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Data Analytics at Arizona State University, I am eager to apply my analytical skills and attention to detail to support your team in this important research.

In my role as a Lead Data Engineer at Click 2 Craft, I developed a custom web scraper using Python, which improved data collection efficiency by 30%. This experience has provided me with a strong foundation in data entry and analysis, essential skills for managing and interpreting research data. I am proficient in Microsoft Excel, where I have utilized advanced functions to analyze data and create reports, ensuring accuracy and usability.

My internship at YWCA in Delhi involved conducting statistical analysis on peer pressure studies, which required meticulous attention to detail and a strong understanding of data collection methods. This experience not only honed my analytical skills but also deepened my interest in medical research and its impact on communities, particularly in relation to autism.

I understand the importance of maintaining high standards in research, and I am committed to ensuring that sample collection kits are prepared accurately and shipped promptly. My organizational skills and ability to follow protocols will contribute to the smooth operation of clinical trials.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to work on autism research and contribute to a field that is vital for improving lives. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background and skills align with the needs of your research team.

Warm Regards,
Armaan Sood
