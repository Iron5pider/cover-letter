Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Recycling Materials Assistant position with Zero Waste at ASU Facilities Management. As a committed student with a strong interest in sustainability and environmental stewardship, I am eager to contribute to the advancement of Arizona State University's zero-waste initiative.

I possess a valid Arizona Driverâ€™s License and have proven my reliability and adaptability in various roles that required effective communication and customer service skills. My background has prepared me to interact with diverse customers on the Tempe Campus, ensuring their needs are met while coordinating recycling efforts. I understand the importance of efficient recycling processes and am motivated by the chance to make a positive impact on campus sustainability.

My physical capabilities enable me to lift and move materials weighing up to 50 pounds, and I am comfortable performing hands-on tasks that require attention to detail and adherence to safety standards. I am eager to learn and operate recycling and waste compactors, and I am willing to undergo any required training to safely operate golf carts and trucks for pick-up routes.

In my previous roles, I demonstrated strong organizational skills and the ability to manage time effectively, completing routine tasks with accuracy and reporting data as required. My familiarity with Microsoft Office applications, such as Excel and Word, as well as Google Forms, equips me to effectively manage schedules, track recycling metrics, and support reporting needs for the department.

I am looking forward to collaborating with full-time employees and assisting in various tasks, including volunteer events and materials handling. As someone who thrives in both independent and team-oriented environments, I am confident in my ability to adjust my work routine as necessary to accomplish goals and respond to urgent tasks as they arise.

Thank you for considering my application for the Recycling Materials Assistant position. I am excited about the opportunity to work with Zero Waste and contribute to sustainable practices on campus. I look forward to discussing how my skills and enthusiasm can support the important work being done at ASU.

Warm Regards,
Armaan Sood
