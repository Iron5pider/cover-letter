In addition to my research experience, I possess excellent verbal and writing skills, enabling me to communicate complex findings clearly and effectively. I am detail-oriented and have a strong analytical mindset, which allows me to follow instructions while also taking the initiative to think creatively and propose process improvement opportunities. My proficiency in Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel has provided me with the skills necessary to collect, analyze, and visualize large datasets, enhancing my ability to present findings in a digestible manner.
