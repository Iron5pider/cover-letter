Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Grader position for Spring 2025 at the School of Human Evolution and Social Change. As a dedicated student majoring in Global Health, I am eager to assist faculty with grading and contribute to the academic success of my peers.

Having completed relevant coursework in both anthropology and global health with grades of A- or higher, I have developed a strong understanding of the subject matter, which positions me well to provide meaningful feedback on assignments. My academic experience has also equipped me with excellent oral and written communication skills, allowing me to articulate complex ideas clearly and effectively.

In previous roles as a peer tutor and research assistant, I gained valuable experience reviewing essays, research papers, and other academic works. I enjoyed evaluating the clarity of arguments and the rigor of research, ensuring that students receive constructive feedback that helps enhance their understanding and performance. I am comfortable using platforms such as Canvas and Zoom, which will enable me to communicate effectively with both faculty and students in a remote setting.

I am organized and detail-oriented, which is essential for grading assignments consistently and accurately. I understand the importance of maintaining confidentiality and integrity in academic settings, and I am committed to upholding these values as a grader.

I am particularly enthusiastic about the opportunity to work closely with the instructional team and attend regular virtual meetings to discuss grading protocols and student progress. I believe this position will not only enhance my own learning but also allow me to contribute positively to the educational experience at ASU.

Thank you for considering my application for the Grader position. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with the needs of the School of Human Evolution and Social Change and how I can support the faculty and students during the Spring 2025 semester.

Warm Regards,
Armaan Sood
