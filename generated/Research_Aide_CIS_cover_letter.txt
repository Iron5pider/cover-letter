Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Research Aide position for the CIS course at the W.P. Carey Department of Information Systems. With a strong academic background in information systems and practical experience in tutoring and assisting fellow students, I am excited about the opportunity to support faculty and contribute to the success of the course.

As a student who has completed coursework in CIS and business analytics, I am familiar with the content and expectations of the CIS and WPC 300 courses. My coursework has provided me with a solid foundation in various CIS programs and languages, including SQL, Python, and Excel, allowing me to understand the nuances of the assignments I would be grading. I have a keen eye for detail, ensuring that I can evaluate assignments fairly and accurately while providing constructive feedback that helps students improve their understanding of the material.

I have experience tutoring my peers in information systems, where I not only helped them grasp complex concepts but also refined my own understanding of the subject matter. This role has enhanced my communication skills, enabling me to explain ideas clearly and adapt my teaching methods to meet the needs of different students. My responsibility and responsiveness have allowed me to develop strong relationships with fellow students, fostering an environment of collaboration and support.

In addition to my academic achievements, I have worked in various positions that have strengthened my organizational and time management skills. I am comfortable with online platforms and am confident in my ability to assist faculty with other assignments beyond grading, as needed. I would be more than willing to hold office hours to provide additional support to students, ensuring they receive the help they need to succeed.

I am thrilled about the possibility of joining the W.P. Carey Department of Information Systems as a Research Aide. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences can contribute to the success of the CIS and WPC 300 courses.

Warm Regards,
Armaan Sood
