Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Custodial Quality Assurance Inspector position with Facilities Development and Management. As a current undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Data Analytics at Arizona State University, I am eager to apply my attention to detail and strong organizational skills to ensure the cleanliness and maintenance of university buildings.

In my previous role as a Security Aide at ASU Gammage, I developed a keen eye for detail while ensuring the safety and satisfaction of over 3,000 patrons during events. This experience required me to assess situations quickly and effectively, skills that will be invaluable when inspecting university buildings for cleaning deficiencies. I am adept at following instructions and have experience documenting incidents, which aligns well with the responsibilities of taking pictures and using an app for inspections.

Additionally, my experience in hotel management at Courtyard by Marriott involved managing front-desk operations, where I was responsible for maintaining a clean and welcoming environment for guests. I developed strong customer service skills and learned the importance of ensuring that all areas were well-stocked and presentable, which directly relates to the duties of checking that trash is emptied and supplies are stocked.

I am comfortable using technology and have experience with various software applications, which will aid in documenting inspections and creating work orders in the TMA system. My ability to ask questions and seek clarification will ensure that I fully understand the custodial cleaning expectations for each room type.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to the cleanliness and quality assurance of university facilities, and I believe my background and skills make me a strong candidate for this position. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can support the Facilities Development and Management team.

Warm Regards,
Armaan Sood
