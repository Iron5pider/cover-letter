Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Analyst position. As a current undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Data Analytics at Arizona State University, I am excited about the opportunity to apply my analytical skills and knowledge of data visualization to support your team in creating dashboards and maps.

In my role as a Lead Data Engineer at Click 2 Craft, I developed a custom web scraper using Python, which improved our data collection efficiency by 30%. This experience not only honed my technical skills in data preparation and validation but also provided me with a strong foundation in using statistical software and tools. I am proficient in Microsoft Excel, where I have utilized advanced functions to analyze data and create tabular summaries of descriptive statistics.

Additionally, my internship at YWCA in Delhi involved conducting statistical analysis and presenting findings, which required effective written and verbal communication skills. I led a team project that resulted in a significant increase in mental health awareness among targeted youth demographics, showcasing my ability to work collaboratively and independently on assigned tasks.

I am familiar with research methods, data collection, and data proofing, and I am comfortable working with various data formats to ensure accuracy and usability. My attention to detail and critical thinking skills will enable me to interpret and present data effectively for written reports.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to contribute to the department's mission by preparing and analyzing data, creating informative dashboards, and supporting data-driven decision-making processes. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the needs of your team.

Warm Regards,
Armaan Sood
