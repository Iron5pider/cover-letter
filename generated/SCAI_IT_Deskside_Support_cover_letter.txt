Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the SCAI IT Deskside Support position at the School of Computing & Augmented Intelligence. As a highly motivated undergraduate student with a strong technical background and previous IT help desk experience, I am excited about the opportunity to assist faculty, staff, and students with their computing needs.

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a solid foundation in troubleshooting various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. My hands-on experience unboxing and setting up new computers and printers, combined with my ability to install and troubleshoot software and hardware, has prepared me to handle the complexities of this role. I am confident in my capability to quickly identify and resolve technical issues, ensuring smooth operations for our users.

I possess familiarity with Microsoft Office, as well as experience with Microsoft Active Directory, SharePoint, and Group Policy. This knowledge allows me to manage user accounts and help resolve issues related to software access and permissions effectively. Additionally, I am comfortable performing computer and equipment inventory tasks, ensuring that assets are tracked and accounted for accurately.

With a valid US Driverâ€™s License and the physical ability to lift up to 50 lbs, I am well-prepared to assist with moving equipment and furniture as needed. I pride myself on my punctuality and reliability, understanding the importance of maintaining a consistent presence in an IT support role. My positive customer service attitude enables me to interact effectively with colleagues and users alike, creating a supportive environment that fosters collaboration.

I am available for the required 20 hours per week during the regular semester, and I am also willing to work during the summer and winter breaks for 30-40 hours. I am eager to learn new technical concepts and tasks, and I look forward to participating in any orientation or training sessions that prepare me for success in the role.

Thank you for considering my application for the SCAI IT Deskside Support position. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and experiences to the SCAI team and support the technological needs of the school. I look forward to the chance to discuss my application further.

Warm Regards,
