Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the position of Creative Technology Outreach Specialist for the NSF-funded project at Arizona State University. With a strong background in circuit bending and a fervent passion for fostering community engagement through the intersection of art and science, I am eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to support this innovative initiative.

Having successfully completed the AME "Circuit Bending" course taught by the Principal Investigator, I have developed a deep understanding of the techniques and creative possibilities that circuit bending offers. This experience has not only honed my technical skills but has also ignited my desire to share this knowledge with diverse audiences, particularly in neurodiverse and underserved communities. I am committed to mentoring individuals of all ages and believe that the collaborative nature of circuit bending can create inclusive spaces for exploration and creativity.

I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to serve as a community ambassador, engaging with attendees at public pop-up events to showcase our creative journeys in hybrid art and technology practices. I have experience in planning and executing community outreach activities and understand the importance of fostering excitement and awareness about STEAM fields. My ability to communicate complex concepts clearly and effectively will help inspire community members to explore circuit bending and electronic music.

In addition to my outreach capabilities, I am enthusiastic about producing educational content for the online video library. I have a proven track record of creating instructional materials and have previously designed circuit bending projects that simplify complex ideas for learners. This aligns perfectly with the goal of sparking interest in STEAM and circuits among community members.

I am also eager to participate in workshops focusing on neurodiversity, glitch art, and circuit bending, as I believe that learning from guest speakers and artists will introduce new perspectives that can enhance our outreach efforts. My collaborative skills, attention to detail, and ability to think outside the box make me a valuable addition to the planning meetings and event proposals.

Thank you for considering my application for the Creative Technology Outreach Specialist position. I look forward to the possibility of contributing my skills and experiences to this exciting project and working to engage the community in meaningful ways.

Warm Regards,
Armaan Sood
